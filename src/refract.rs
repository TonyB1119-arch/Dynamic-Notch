//! The glass edge: a snapshot of the desktop behind the notch, bent along the rim like thick glass.
//!
//! A snapshot of the screen is taken when the notch opens (while the window is still small, so it
//! does not photograph itself). The rim is worked out from it on the CPU for the notch's current
//! size and uploaded as one small picture, drawn with a single call; it is only made again when the
//! size changes (while a page change resizes the notch, and never while nothing moves).
//!
//! Live glass: while the notch is open the screen is looked at again every so often, on a
//! background thread (`refresh`). The notch is hidden from screen copies for that (the window
//! is excluded from capture), so the copy shows only what is really behind it. A copy that turns
//! out identical to the last one (as far as the rim can see) is thrown away at once.
